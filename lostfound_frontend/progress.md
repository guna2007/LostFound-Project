# MODULE 5 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS (Previous)

## Phase 1: Core Logic Setup ✅

### Status: COMPLETED

### Changes Made:

1. ✅ Updated `src/types/IItem.ts` - Added `reporter_id` field
2. ✅ Updated `src/lib/utils.ts` - Added `MOCK_USER_ID` constant
3. ✅ Updated `src/lib/api.ts` - Added `reporter_id` to mock items and created `login()` function
4. ✅ Updated `src/lib/hooks.ts` - Created `useAuth()` hook with localStorage persistence

### Detailed Changes:

#### File: `src/types/IItem.ts`

**What:** Added `reporter_id: string` to both `IItem` and `IItemCreate` interfaces
**Why:** Enables user-level item association for multi-user functionality
**Impact:** All items now track who reported them

#### File: `src/lib/utils.ts`

**What:** Added `MOCK_USER_ID = 'user-123'` and `MOCK_ADMIN_ID = 'admin-456'` constants
**Why:** Centralizes mock user identification for testing and development
**Impact:** Consistent user IDs across the application

#### File: `src/lib/api.ts`

**What:**

- Added `reporter_id` to all 10 mock items (some assigned to MOCK_USER_ID, others to different users)
- Created `login(email, password)` function that returns AuthResponse with token, userId, email, role
- Created `register(email, password, name)` function for mock registration
- Mock credentials: user@lostfound.com/user123 and admin@lostfound.com/admin123
  **Why:** Simulates backend authentication logic, ready for real API integration
  **Impact:** Full authentication system working locally

#### File: `src/lib/hooks.ts`

**What:** Created `useAuth()` hook with:

- State: `isLoggedIn`, `isAdmin`, `userId`, `userEmail`, `token`
- Methods: `login()`, `logout()`
- localStorage persistence for session management (key: 'lostfound_auth')
- Initializes from localStorage on mount
  **Why:** Provides centralized auth state management for protected routing
  **Impact:** Authentication persists across page refreshes

---

## Phase 2: Authentication Pages + Route Protection ✅

### Status: COMPLETED

### Changes Made:

1. ✅ Created `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx` - HOC for route protection
2. ✅ Updated `src/pages/LoginPage.tsx` - Complete login form with auth integration
3. ✅ Updated `src/pages/RegisterPage.tsx` - Complete registration form
4. ✅ Updated `src/App.tsx` - Added protected routes and auth routing
5. ✅ Updated `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` - Added logout button when logged in

### Detailed Changes:

#### File: `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx` (NEW)

**What:** Created higher-order component that wraps protected routes

- Checks `isLoggedIn` from useAuth hook
- Redirects to `/login` if not authenticated
- Has `requireAdmin` prop for admin-only routes
- Redirects to `/` if user is not admin but admin is required
  **Why:** Reusable route protection pattern
  **Impact:** Dashboard and Admin routes now require authentication

#### File: `src/pages/LoginPage.tsx`

**What:**

- Integrated `useAuth()` hook
- Connected form to real `login()` function
- Added toast notifications for success/error
- Redirects to dashboard on success
- Auto-redirects if already logged in
- Added demo credentials info box (user@lostfound.com/user123, admin@lostfound.com/admin123)
  **Why:** Professional login flow with real auth logic
  **Impact:** Users can now login and see protected pages

#### File: `src/pages/RegisterPage.tsx`

**What:**

- Connected to `register()` API function
- Added form validation (password match, terms acceptance)
- Toast notifications for validation errors
- Redirects to login page after successful registration
- Auto-redirects if already logged in
  **Why:** Complete registration flow
  **Impact:** Users can register (mock) and proceed to login

#### File: `src/App.tsx`

**What:**

- Wrapped `/dashboard` route with `<ProtectedRoute>`
- Wrapped `/admin` route with `<ProtectedRoute requireAdmin>`
- Imported ProtectedRoute component
  **Why:** Enforces authentication at the routing level
  **Impact:** Unauthorized access redirects to login

#### File: `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`

**What:**

- Added `useAuth()` hook integration
- Shows Dashboard and Admin links only when logged in
- Shows Admin link only to admin users
- Shows user email and Logout button when authenticated
- Shows Login link when not authenticated
- Updated both desktop and mobile navigation
- `handleLogout()` function clears auth and redirects to home
  **Why:** Dynamic navigation based on auth state
  **Impact:** Clean, intuitive navigation experience

---

## Phase 3: User Dashboard (CRUD Integration) ✅

### Status: COMPLETED

### Changes Made:

1. ✅ Updated `src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx` - Filtered items by user, added edit/delete
2. ✅ Edit modal integrated directly (no separate component needed)
3. ✅ `useDeleteItem()` and `useUpdateItem()` hooks already existed in hooks.ts
4. ✅ Updated `src/pages/ReportLostPage.tsx` - Auto-assigns reporter_id on creation
5. ✅ Updated `src/pages/ReportFoundPage.tsx` - Auto-assigns reporter_id on creation

### Detailed Changes:

#### File: `src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`

**What:** Complete dashboard rewrite with:

- Filters items by `item.reporter_id === userId`
- Stats cards showing total, lost, and found items
- Grid layout with all user's items
- Edit button on each item opens modal
- Delete button with confirmation dialog
- Edit modal with form for title, description, category, location
- Toast notifications for all actions
- Empty state with call-to-action
- Loading states
  **Why:** Users need to manage their own items only
  **Impact:** Full CRUD functionality for user's items

#### File: `src/pages/ReportLostPage.tsx`

**What:**

- Integrated `useAddItem()` hook
- Gets `userId` from `useAuth()` hook
- Assigns `reporter_id: userId || MOCK_USER_ID` when creating item
- Calls actual API mutation instead of mock timeout
- Toast success/error feedback
- Redirects to dashboard after creation
  **Why:** Items must be associated with the reporting user
  **Impact:** New items automatically linked to current user

#### File: `src/pages/ReportFoundPage.tsx`

**What:**

- Same changes as ReportLostPage
- Assigns `reporter_id` to current user
- Uses `useAddItem()` mutation
- Status set to 'FOUND' instead of 'LOST'
  **Why:** Same user association requirements
  **Impact:** Found items also tracked by reporter

---

## Phase 4: Admin Dashboard Enhancement �

### Status: OPTIONAL (Current admin dashboard is functional)

### Note:

The admin dashboard page exists with basic structure. Full AdminItemTable integration was not completed in this module as the focus was on user authentication and user-specific CRUD operations. Admin dashboard can be enhanced in a future module.

The `/admin` route is already protected with `requireAdmin` flag, so only admin users can access it.

---
